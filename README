To setup the environment:
    $ scl enable python27 bash
    $ source esmond/esmond.env

Then navigate to /esmond/esmonduploader. Inside this folder is the file, 
esmonduploader.py, for the class that handles getting and posting the 
data from the nodes. The other file, caller.py, creates and instance of 
the class and takes command line options that can alter the default 
settings of the script, such as what host to connect to, the window of 
time for the age of the data that is alowed to be collected, etc. To see 
a full list of options, how to use them, and what their default argument 
is, type:
    $ python caller.py -h 
or
    $ python caller.py --help

If you would just like to run the get/post script under default settings, 
enter:
    $ python caller.py -p
or
    $ python caller.py --post

An example of setting the script to get/post data with a window 
of a day before-hand to present time from the perfsonar url 
"http://hcc-pki-ps01.unl.edu":
    $ python caller.py --start -86400 --end 0 --url hcc-pki-ps01.unl.edu --post

The --start -86400 option tells the script to look for data no older than 
86400 seconds (3600 seconds/hour * 24 hours in a day) or a day old.

The --end 0 option tells the script to look for data no younger than 0 
seconds old, or basically any data younger than the --start argument up until 
the script runs (0 is the default for --end so this option could be left out).

The --url http://hcc-pki-ps01.unl.edu option specifies which url to query data 
from, in this case the node "http://hcc-pki-ps01.unl.edu". 
NOTE: DON'T FORGET THE HTTP

The --post option tells the script to run with the options it has been given. 
If options to some or all fields are not given, it will use the 
default options.

In addition, the less verbose option of each option may be used to use 
caller.py quicker, and any options that are the same as the default can be 
left off. The example above could be written as:
    $ python caller.py -s -86400 -u hcc-pki-ps01.unl.edu -p
